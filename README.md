## 📌 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry, where retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project applies a full predictive analytics and machine learning workflow to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using the **Telco Customer Churn dataset**.


The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and provide actionable business insights that can help telecom companies improve customer retention strategies.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Predict whether a customer is likely to churn
- Identify the most important factors driving churn
- Compare multiple machine learning models
- Translate model outputs into business-relevant recommendations
- Address ethical and responsible AI considerations

---

## 📊 Dataset Description
- **Dataset:** Telco Customer Churn
- **Source:** Kaggle / IBM Sample Dataset
- **Observations:** 7,043 customers
- **Features:** 21 customer attributes
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Yes / No → 1 / 0)

The dataset includes customer demographics, service subscriptions, contract details, billing information, and churn status.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Environment:** Google Colab
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas, numpy
  - matplotlib, seaborn

## ⚖️ Ethics & Responsible AI

This project considers ethical implications related to customer data usage and predictive modeling:

- Potential bias in customer demographics
- Fairness across age, gender, and contract types
- Risk of unfair targeting or exclusion
- Importance of model transparency and explainability

The models are intended to **support decision-making**, not replace human judgment. Predictions should be used responsibly with customer-centric policies.
