📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical challenge in the telecommunications industry, where retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project applies a complete predictive analytics and machine learning pipeline to analyze customer behavior and predict churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.

The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer churn and convert analytical insights into actionable business recommendations that telecom companies can use to improve customer retention and profitability.

🎯 Business Objectives

Predict whether a customer is likely to churn

Identify the most influential factors driving churn

Compare multiple machine learning models

Translate technical results into business-oriented insights

Address ethical and responsible AI considerations

📈 Key Analytical Insights

Customer churn rate is approximately 27%, indicating a major retention challenge

Customers on month-to-month contracts show significantly higher churn

Short-tenure customers are the most likely to leave

Customers with high monthly charges churn at higher rates

Electronic check payment users exhibit the highest churn risk

Senior citizens demonstrate elevated churn behavior, requiring targeted strategies

⚖️ Ethics & Responsible AI

This project considers ethical implications associated with predictive modeling:

Potential bias related to age, contract type, and payment method

Fairness considerations across demographic groups

Privacy and responsible handling of customer data

Risk of misuse of churn predictions for unfair targeting

The model is intended to support business decisions, not replace human judgment. All predictions should be applied using ethical, customer-centric policies.
